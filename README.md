 Django REST API Project

This project is a Django-based REST API that provides a backend service for managing `Item` resources. It utilizes Django REST Framework (DRF) to create a robust, scalable, and easy-to-use API for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Features

- Model-Driven: Uses Django's ORM to interact with the database, allowing easy management of `Item` resources.
- RESTful Endpoints: Provides full CRUD functionality via RESTful endpoints.
- Automatic API Documentation: DRF's built-in capabilities provide interactive API documentation.
- Scalability: Designed to be easily extensible with additional models and views.
